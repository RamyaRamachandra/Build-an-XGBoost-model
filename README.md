# Build-an-XGBoost-model

### Introduction
In this activity, you’ll build on the skills and techniques you learned in the decision tree and random forest lessons to construct your own XGBoost classification model. The XGBoost model is a very powerful extension of decision trees, so having a strong working familiarity with this process will strengthen your skills and resume as a data professional.

This activity is a continuation of the airlines project in which you built decision tree and random forest models. You will use the same data, but this time you will train, tune, and evaluate an XGBoost model. You’ll then compare the performance of all three models and decide which model is best. Finally, you’ll explore the feature importances of your model and identify the features that most contribute to customer satisfaction.
